  <h1>The Boy in the Red Vest</h1>
  <h2>Paul Cézanne</h2>
  <p>1889</p>
  <p> Cézanne painted four oil portraits of this Italian boy in the red vest, all
    in different poses, which allowed him to study the relationship between the
    figure and space. The most famous of the four, and the one commonly referred
    to by this title, is the one which depicts the boy in a melancholic seated
    pose with his elbow on a table and his head cradled in his hand. It is currently
    held in Zürich, Switzerland. The other three portraits, of different poses, are
    in museums in the US</p>
