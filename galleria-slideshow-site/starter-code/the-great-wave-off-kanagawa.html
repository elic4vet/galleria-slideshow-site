  <h1>The Great Wave off Kanagawa</h1>
  <h2>Hokusai</h2>
  <p>1831</p>
  <p>The Great Wave off Kanagawa (Japanese: 神奈川沖浪裏, Hepburn: Kanagawa-oki Nami
    Ura, lit. "Under the Wave off Kanagawa"), also known as The Great Wave or simply
    The Wave, is a woodblock print by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai. It was
    published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late Edo period as the first
    print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. The image depicts an
    enormous wave threatening three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay (Kanagawa
    Prefecture) while Mount Fuji rises in the background.</p>
