  <h1>Van Gogh Self-portrait</h1>
  <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
  <p>1889</p>
  <p>This self-portrait was one of about 32 produced over a 10-year period, and these
    were an important part of his work as a painter; he painted himself because he
    often lacked the money to pay for models. He took the painting with him to
    Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul Gachet, who thought
    it was "absolutely fanatical". Art historians are divided as to whether this
    painting or Self-portrait without beard is Van Gogh's final self-portrait. The
    art historians Ingo F. Walther and Jan Hulsker consider this to be the last.</p>
