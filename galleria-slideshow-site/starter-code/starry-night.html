  <h1>Starry Night</h1>
  <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
  <p>1889</p>
  <p> Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor
    studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory.
    The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a
    view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including
    The Starry Night. "Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo,
    around 23 May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the
    morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."</p>
