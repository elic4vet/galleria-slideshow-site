  <h1>The Sleeping Gypsy</h1>
  <h2>Henri Rousseau</h2>
  <p>1897</p>
  <p>The Sleeping Gypsy (French: La Bohémienne endormie) is an 1897 oil painting by
    French Naïve artist Henri Rousseau (1844–1910). It is a fantastical depiction
    of a lion musing over a sleeping woman on a moonlit night. Rousseau first
    exhibited the painting at the 13th Salon des Indépendants, and tried unsuccessfully
    to sell it to the mayor of his hometown, Laval. Instead, it entered the private
    collection of a Parisian charcoal merchant where it remained until 1924, when it
    was discovered by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles."</p>
