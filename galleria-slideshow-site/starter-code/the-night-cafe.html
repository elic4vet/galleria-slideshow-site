  <h1>The Night Café</h1>
  <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
  <p>1888</p>
  <p>The Night Café (French: Le Café de nuit) is an oil painting created by Dutch
    artist Vincent van Gogh in September 1888 in Arles. Its title is inscribed
    lower right beneath the signature. The painting is owned by Yale University
    and is currently held at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven,
    Connecticut. The interior depicted is the Café de la Gare, 30 Place Lamartine,
    run by Joseph-Michel Ginoux and his wife Marie, who in November 1888 posed for
    Van Gogh's and Gauguin's Arlésienne; a bit later, Joseph Ginoux evidently posed
    for both artists, too.</p>
