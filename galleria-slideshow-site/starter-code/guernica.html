  <h1>Guernica</h1>
  <h2>Pablo Picasso</h2>
  <p id="date">1937</p>
  <p> The scene occurs within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over
    a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. In the center of the room a
    horse falls in agony with a large gaping hole in its side, as if it had just been
    run through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears to be wearing chain mail
    armor, decorated with vertical tally marks arranged in rows. A dead and dismembered
    soldier lies under the horse. The hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered
    sword, from which a flower grows.</p>
