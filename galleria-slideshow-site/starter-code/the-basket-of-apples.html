  <h1>The Basket of Apples</h1>
  <h2>Paul Cézanne</h2>
  <p>1893</p>
  <p> The Basket of Apples (French: Le panier de pommes) is a still life oil painting
    by French artist Paul Cézanne, which he created c. 1893. The painting is
    particularly remarkable for its creative composition, which rejected realistic
    representation in favour of distorting objects to create multiple perspectives.
    This approach eventually influenced other art movements, including Fauvism and
    Cubism. It belongs to the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection of the Art
    Institute of Chicago.</p>
